In this day and age, A personal branding website has outweight traditional resumes.
firstly because it is easier to update your resume of your ongoing projects where as the traditional resume are'nt able to update at real time

my personal skills and experience to pique the interest of others. 
<h1>Design Process</h1>

<h2>Design Rational</h2>
<hr>
initially i went to do some research and get some inspirations from other resume websites!!<br>
1st inspiration:"https://zyro.com/preview/brooke#desktop"<br>
2nd inspiration:"http://www.garysheng.com/"<br>
<hr>
so firstly i had to design a wireframe,The wireframe Consists of different page sections scrolling down~~

So on the first page I decided that it should have an short introduction on who i am and a photo of me <br><br>
on the 2nd section I decided that it will be a "about me" page , to tell other's my aspirations and long term goal.<br><br>
on the 3rd section i have an Education Page that shows where i studied from and what are the things i did in school. <br><br>
on the 4th section i decided to have an Skills and proficiency page to show off my skills on some programming language such as Python,Sql and html and also showcase some of my personal traits which employers look for in a employee such as Leadership and critical thinking.<br><br>
on the 5th page i decided to show some of the projects i have done and a short description on what it is about<br><br>
so lastly on the final page it is a Contact me Page where people can key in their details and i will contact them, i also included my social media accounts such as linkedin,instagram and facebook so employers can contact me through there too.<br>

<h2>Thought Process of things i want to implement! </h2>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>When user hovers across the navigation bar it will trigger an animation which then have a line appear below the navigation!
<li>When the user hovers across the text and it changes color 
<li>Maybe i can have my picture Fade in when the user first load the page~
<li>some nice background which will look modern and draw in user's attention
</ul>
